# AlgorithmMonitor
AlgorithmMonitor is a Swift-based application designed to visualize and monitor various algorithms. The app provides both step-by-step and automatic sorting animations, as well as searching animations, allowing users to observe the algorithm process in detail. This tool is ideal for educational purposes, helping users understand how these algorithms work.

## Features
- **Automatic Sorting Animation**: Watch the Bubble Sort and Selection Sort algorithm sort the array in real-time.
- **Step-by-Step Sorting**: Control the sorting process step-by-step to gain a deeper understanding.
- **Customizable Array**: Adjust the size of the array to be sorted.
- **Pause and Resume**: Pause the sorting process at any time and resume when ready.
- Real-time Updates: Observe active indices and array states during the sorting process.

## Getting Started
### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yordgenome03/AlgorithmMonitor.git
    ```
1. Open the project in Xcode:
    ```
    cd AlgorithmMonitor
    open AlgorithmMonitor.xcodeproj
    ```
1. Build and run the project in the Xcode simulator or on a connected iOS device.

## Usage
- **Initial Setup**: On launching the app, a randomized array will be generated.
- **Start Sorting**: Click the "Start" button to begin the sorting process. The array will be sorted automatically if animation is enabled.
- **Step Forward**: Use the "Step Forward" button to manually proceed through each step of the sorting process.
- **Pause and Resume**: The "Pause" button will halt the sorting process, and clicking "Start" again will resume it.
- **Reset Array**: Click the "Reset" button to shuffle the array and start a new sorting session.
- **Adjust Settings**: Use the settings menu to change the array size and toggle animations.
